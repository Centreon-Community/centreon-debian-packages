Description: Class to automatically build HTML_QuickForm objects from a DB_DataObject-derived class
 DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application
 development using the packages DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For
 having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply
 model the database, run DataObject&apos;s createTable script over it
 and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the
 FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a
 simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test
 your application. It also provides a processing method that will
 automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be
 executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up
 DataObject&apos;s links.ini file correctly, it will also
 automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will
 populate a selectbox with the linked table&apos;s entries. There are
 many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini
 or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to
 fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into
 fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the
 process.
