CURRENT TESTED PLATFORMS
------------------------
  - Linux 2.2+
  - FreeBSD 4.x
  - OpenBSD 2.8+
  - NetBSD
  - Darwin/OSX
  - WinNT
  - PHP 4.x and 5.x

  If your platform is not here try checking out the mailing list archives or
  the message boards on SourceForge.


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
  Just decompress and untar the source (which you should have done by now,
  if you're reading this...), into your webserver's document root.

  There is a configuration file called config.php.new. If this a brand 
  new installation, you should copy this file to config.php and edit it.

  - make sure your 'php.ini' file's include_path entry contains "."
  - make sure your 'php.ini' has safe_mode set to 'off'.

  Please keep in the mind that because phpSysInfo requires access to many
  files in /proc and other system binary you **MUST DISABLE** php's
  safe_mode.  Please see the PHP documentation for information on how you
  can do this.

  That's it.  Restart your webserver (if you changed php.ini), and viola!


KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
  - phpSysInfo is not full compatible with SELinux Systems
  - small bug under FreeBSD with memory reporting
  - XML will not work properly/validate under anything except Linux and
    Net/FreeBSD The "This is Under Development" warning gets printed and
	isn't valid in XML.


PLATFORM SPECIFIC ISSUES
------------------------
  - FreeBSD
    There is currently a bug in FreeBSD that if you boot your system up and
	drop to single user mode and then again back to multiuser the system
	removes /var/run/dmesg.boot.  This will cause phpsysinfo to fail.  A bug
	has already been reported to the FreeBSD team.  (PS, this may exist in
	other *BSDs also)


WHAT TO DO IF IT DOESN'T WORK
-----------------------------
  First make sure you've read this file completely, especially the
  "INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION" section.  If it still doesn't work then
  you can:
  
  Submit a bug on SourceForge. (preferred)
     (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsysinfo/)


OTHER NOTES
-----------
  If you have an great ideas or wanna help out, just drop by the project
  page at SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpsysinfo/)
